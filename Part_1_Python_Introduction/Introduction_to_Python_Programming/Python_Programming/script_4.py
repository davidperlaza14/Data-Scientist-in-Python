In the previous exercise, we gave the computer three instructions:

print(0.00)
print(2130805)
print(4.5)

Collectively, we call all these instructions code. We call each line of instruction a line of code.

When we write code, we program the computer to do something. For this reason, we also call the code we write a computer program (or a program). The program we wrote in the previous exercise had three lines of code, but a program can be as small as one line.

The code we write serves as input to the computer. We call the result of executing the code output.

As we've learned, we can display the output using the print()function. Note, however, that Python executes the code regardless of whether we use print() or not. In the example below, we don't see the output of 0.00 + 6.99 because we did not specify print().

0.00 + 6.99
print(4.5 - 3.5)

Output
1.0

Now let's practice writing more code. Refer to the dataset to complete this exercise:

Instructions

1. Using the print() function, write a program that sums (adds together) the cost of purchasing the Fruit Ninja Classic and the Minecraft: Pocket Edition apps. Refer to the table for the price of each app.
